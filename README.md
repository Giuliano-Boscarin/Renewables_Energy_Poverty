# Assessing the Impact of Renewable Energy Expansion on Energy Poverty among EU Countries

This project explores how the growth of renewable energy impacts energy poverty in EU countries, focusing on equitable distribution among different income groups. The analysis includes trend studies, correlation analysis, and time-series forecasting.

### Methods
1. **Trend Analysis**: Investigate recent trends in renewable energy adoption across EU countries.
2. **Correlation Studies**: Analyze the relationship between renewable energy capacity, energy costs, and access, particularly for low-income populations.
3. **Economic Analysis**: Examine the relationship between GDP per capita and renewable energy adoption.
4. **Forecasting**: Use time-series models to predict future trends in renewable energy and energy poverty.
